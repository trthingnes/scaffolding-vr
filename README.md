### **"Why am I getting these errors?"**
You need BNG Framework.


### **"Where to start?"**

All Construction Sector-specific content should go into Assets/ConstructionScenario/*


### Make sure to use the following conventions:
_ (taken from the main VR4VET repository)_

Coding conventions are used to make the project more uniform and understandable.

Usig directives should be outside the class

Classes, record or structs should be PascalCase

Interfaces should be prefixed with "I"

Public variable should also be PascalPase

Local variables etc. should be named in camelCase.

Private variables etc. should be named with _underscore and camelCase.

Static variables should be prefixed with "s_" and StaticThreads with "t_"

Method parameters should be camelCase

Continuation lines should be indented by one tab stop

One blank line between each method after method or property definition

All related files should be put in a folder. These are the basic rules to follow when writing code for VR4VET Most of this was taken from Microsofts C# guide:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions
